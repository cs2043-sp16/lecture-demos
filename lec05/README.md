# Counting and Sorting, Committing to your Changes

You now have the file `frankenstein.txt` in this directory.  Fill in each `p*.sh` with a *minimal* script (most can be one line).  When you are done, make each `p*.sh` executable, commit, and push your changes to your forked repository.

## p1.sh

Calculate the minimum used word in `frankenstein.txt`.

## p2.sh

Calculate the maximum used character in `frankenstein.txt`.

## p3.sh

Calculate the number of times the word `monster` appears in `frankenstein.txt`.

## p4.sh

Extract the 10 most used words in Letter 3 of `frankenstein.txt`.  Words should contain no punctuation marks and the different forms of words with capital and lower case letters should be considered the same word, e.g., "The" and "the" are the same words, and "tree!" and "man," are not words, but the trimmed version "tree" and "man" are.

Hint: Letter 3 is between lines 255 and 298 of the file frankenstein.txt.
